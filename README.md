# Structural Equation Modelling         

## Abstract             3 June 2018

Using a personality dataset from Goldberg et. al. (2000), a series of Structural Equation Models were built to estimate the latent variables Extroversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness. The model indicated that there is a large amount of cross loading between various items and different latent factors, and strong correlations between items.  

This model showed that on average there was a positive correlation between the trait Extroversion and the traits Agreeableness, Consciousnesses, and Openness, while there was a negative correlation with the trait Neuroticism. It was also found that on average there was a negative correlation between the trait Neuroticism and the traits Consciousnesses and Openness. In addition, it was found on average there was a positive correlation between the trait Agreeableness and Consciousnesses and Openness.  

It was found that Women on average have higher levels of the traits Extroversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness and Consciousnesses, while Men were found to be higher on average in the trait Openness. 

The data also indicated that age on average has a mild negative effect on the trait Neuroticism, which implies that as one ages, the amount of negative emotion experienced should decrease on average. 

The psychological structure of a number of different countries were also explored, indicating which countries tended to be higher or lower on average in the psychological traits.
